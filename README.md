# Unlabeled Deep Learning Models: Implementation and Comparison

## Overview
This is GitHub repo for implementations of two state of the art unlabeled deep learning models (Moco and MixMatch). 
Further, it compares the two models with a benchmark RESNET model. All models are implemented and tuned with image 
classification tasks. The implemented models have comparable accuracy with official implementations. The code and 
demonstration notebooks are provided for easy of use of these models.

## Usage
The folder MixMatch contains benchmark models and our implementation of MixMatch models, a semi-supervised type of model.

The folder MoCo contains our implementation of MoCo models, an un-supervised type of model.

Please refer to the ReadMe file in MixMatch and MoCo folder respectively to run the models and experiments.
